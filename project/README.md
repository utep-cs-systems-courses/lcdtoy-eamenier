# Project 2

This project runs on the msp430 using the 'make install' command in the timerLib
directory, then proceeding to use 'make' and 'make load' in the project
directory. The program quickly blinks the leds once it is ready to run then
plays the Super Mrio theme song on switches one and four. Switches two and
three will blink the leds. The leds will also blink after the song finishes playing.
